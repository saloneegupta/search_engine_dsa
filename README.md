Exracting Information by matching regex, A Search Engine

This project was created in python, using IDF to create a search engine. It parses through various types of media, including pdf, docx, png, jpeg etc to give a score and rank on the basis of maximum relevancy in comparison to the searched word. As the initial file was lost, the code was recreated and therefore might have indentation problems.
